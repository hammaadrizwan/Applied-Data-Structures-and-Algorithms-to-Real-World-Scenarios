# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Projects
###### Number of Different Data Structures and Algorithms used for Real World Scenarions

## Scenario 1: Capital Gain Tracker
##### Queue data structure has been used inorder to follow the LIFO principle as we remove the share that has been in the stock for the longest. An Array is the data structure that hold the nuumber of shres for a particular day.

## Scenario 2: Card Game Simulator
##### A linked list is used to store all the cards, using pointers to be more memory effieicent 

## Scenario 3: Spellchecker
##### Binary Search tree is used to find the word within a list of 100,000 words. All possible suggesttions are being generated for the incorrect word

## Scenario 4: Spellchecker with phonetic substitutions 
##### This is an advanced algorithm that uses metaphone algorithm.
